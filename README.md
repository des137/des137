## Quantum Computational Scientist

- I am a Computational Scientist in the IBM Quantum team. I develop and test quantum algorithms designed for near-term quantum computers. 

- Before my current role as a Computational Scientist, I worked as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer in leading financial institutions, where I helped deploy machine learning models into production business workflows.
